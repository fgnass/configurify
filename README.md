# configurify

A browserify transform to evaluate dynamic expressions on the server and expose
them as static snapshot.

### When to use

Consider using configurify when you would otherwise use
[envify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/envify) but don't want to define
individual environment variables for every single config option.

With configurify you can instead use one single var to decide which set of
config options to load. Where exactly the actual data comes from (a file,
a database, remote service) doesn't matter.

### How it works

Lets say you have a `conf` module that exposes a different set of config
options depending on its environement:

```js
var profile = process.env.NODE_CONF || 'default';

// Note the dynamic require expression:
module.exports = require('./' + profile);
```

The configurify transform will require (and therefore execute) the module on the
server and serialize the exported object using `JSON.stringify()`.

The browserify bundle will then contain that serialized object rather than your
original code.

Whether the transform is applied to a certain module depends on the module's
file name. By default all files that match the `**/conf/*` glob pattern will be
transformed.

### Usage

The easiest way to use (and optionally configure) the transform is to add it to
your project's package.json:

```json
{
  "browserify": {
    "transform": [
      [["configurify", { "pattern": "**/conf/*" }]]
    ]
  }
}
```

### Async Example

Your module may also obtain its configuration asynchronously. Simply export a
function that takes a node-style callback as argument:

```js
var request = require('request');

module.exports = function(cb) {
  request.get('http://localhost:8080/config.json', function(err, res, body) {
    if (err) return cb(err);
    cb(null, JSON.parse(body));
  });
}
```
